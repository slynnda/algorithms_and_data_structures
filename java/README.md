# Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS)

This package consists of my toy implementations of various algorithms and data structures, in Java. It is simply
a means for me to keep my knowledge fresh. However, if you decide to read the code and end up learning something
new from it, please drop a comment. I'm always open to feedback about my code.

__NOTE__: The package that all of these algorithms fall under is called `io.sophialhudson.ads`. The `ads` moniker does
not stands for "ads" in the advertisement sense. It's simply an Ã¼ber-contraction of `algorithmsanddatastructures`, which is
neither pretty to look at nor type.
