# algorithms_and_data_structures

This repository contains my toy implementations of various algorithms and data structures across different languages. The majority (if not all) of these are sub-optimal, compared to the implementations provided in the standard libraries of each respective language, so I'd steer clear of using these in production code. They are mostly here for my own edification and to hopefully impose on you the idea that I'm not the worst coder in the world.
